Problem Description
    In this assignment, you will utilize numpy to analyze student grades
    stored in a CSV file. You will perform various statistical calculations
    and operations to gain insights into the dataset. This assignment will
    help you practice data manipulation and analysis using numpy arrays.
    Instructions:
    Use your CSV file from your Programming Exercise CSV in Week 7. (The file
    should have at least 10 students in it, so rerun your code to have at
    least 10 if needed).
    Load the data from the CSV file into a numpy array.
    Print the first few rows of the dataset to understand its structure.
    Calculate and print the following statistics for each exam (columns):
        Mean (average)
        Median
        Standard deviation
        Minimum
        Maximum
    Calculate and print the overall statistics for the entire dataset (all
    exams combined):
        Mean (average) grade across all exams
        Median grade across all exams
        Standard deviation of grades across all exams
        Minimum grade across all exams
        Maximum grade across all exams
    Determine and print the number of students who passed and failed each
    exam. Consider a passing grade as 60 or above.
    Calculate and print the overall pass percentage across all exams.
    You should have at least two functions, but you can have more.
    Submit your .py file and the .csv file in this assignment and in your
    repository.
    You DO NOT NEED a technical design document for this assignment.
