Problem Description
    Write a program asking the user for a list of their monthly expenses. When
    asking the user for their expenses, ask for the type of expense and the
    amount. Use the reduce method to analyze the expenses and display the
    total expense, the highest expense and the lowest expense. Label what the
    highest and lowest expense is.
    *You can use separate functions for your calculations or you can use
    lambda functions within your main function to do this.
    You must also have a technical design document (refer to the Submitting
    Assignments Module).
    Submit both your .py file and .doc/.docx file in this assignment and these
    files must also be in your repository."""
