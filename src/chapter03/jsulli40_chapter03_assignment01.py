Problem Description
    Spam (or junk email) costs U.S. organizations billions of dollars a year
    in spam-prevention software, equipment, network resources, bandwidth, and
    lost productivity. Research online some of the most common spam email
    messages and words. Create a list of 30 words and phrases commonly found
    in spam messages. Write an application in which the user enters an email
    message. Then your application will scan the message for each of the 30
    keywords or phrases. For each occurrence of one of these within the
    message, add a point to the message's "spam score". Next, rate the
    likelihood that the message is spam, based on the number of points
    received. Display the user's spam score, the likelihood message that it is
    spam, and the words/phrases which caused it to be spam.
    You should have at least two functions, but you can have more.
    You must also have a technical design document (refer to the Submitting
    Assignments Module).
    Submit both your .py file and .doc/.docx file in this assignment and these
    files must also be in your repository."""
