Problem Description
    Using the Deck object presented in Section 11.5, write a game program that
    deals a Poker hand of five cards. Then prompt the user to enter a series
    of numbers (for example: 1, 3, 5) that selects cards to be replaced during
    a draw phrase. Then print the result of drawing the new cards.
    You should have at least two functions, but you can have more.
    Submit your .py file in this assignment and in your repository.
    You DO NOT NEED a technical design document for this assignment.
